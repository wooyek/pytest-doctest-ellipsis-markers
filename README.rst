Setup additional values for ELLIPSIS_MARKER for doctests

----

This `Pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `Cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.


Features
--------


Doctest has problems with matching default ELLIPSIS_MARKER at the begging of line and
interprets them as line continuation characters and not as ellipsis for the output.
The easy way was to use `# doctest: +SKIP`::

    >>> u'Tanie dranie niesÅ‚ychanie' # doctest: +SKIP
    ...

Without `SKIP` it would not work. But then the statement is not tested :(

This plugin cant extend `ELLIPSIS_MARKER` mathing a little
without actually changing the default `ELLIPSIS_MARKER` value::

    >>> u'Adios pomidory'
    '...'
